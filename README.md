# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my personal solutions to [**Advent of Code 2025**](https://adventofcode.com).

## Running

Each example solution is a separate binary, so you can build and run any individual solution with `cargo run --bin <name>`.  For example: to run Day 1 Part 1 use `cargo run --bin d1_p1`.

## Input

[**AoC**](https://adventofcode.com) input files are account specific so mine are not included here.
If you wish to try a solution, all problem binaries have the example input in a constant named EXAMPLE_INPUT.
Alternatively you can get your own input and save it into the `inputs` folder as `d<day_number>.txt`.
